# InvScript
Advanced script for collecting equipment data, significantly optimizing the computer inventory procedure.  


I developed this script due to the high demand for new equipment acquired by the Curitiba City Hall. At that time, the inventory team obtained the inventory information manually. With that in mind, I created this script that runs on basically all versions of Windows, collects basic computer information such as processor, RAM, storage, operating system, MAC address, and serial number, and saves them in a text file. This significantly optimized the inventory process.

Developed in Visual Basic Script and retrieves the following information: 
- Serial number
- hostname
- MAC Address
- Motherboard
- Processor
- Memory
- HDD/SSD
- IP
- Graphics card.

It saves all the information in a .txt file with the hostname as the title.
